How the Strategy Pattern builds on polymorphism?
================================================

🔍 First, What Is Polymorphism?
Different classes can be treated as the same type (usually via an interface or superclass), and the correct
method implementation is chosen at runtime.
For example, both CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment use polymorphism—they implement the same interface differently.


💡 Then What Is the Strategy Pattern?
========================================
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that:
Allows a class to select one of many behaviors (algorithms) at runtime using an interchangeable family of strategies (objects).

It uses polymorphism under the hood — but its goal is higher-level:
	Encapsulate interchangeable behaviors
	Delegate the decision to the calling context
	
NOTE: 👉 This is more than polymorphism — this is strategy injection and dynamic behavior switching.
	  👉 Uses runtime dispatch to swap behavior
	  
	  
✅ Why the code structure of Strategy Pattern and polymorphism is the same?
==========================================================================
At the core, the **Strategy Pattern **relies on polymorphism. So naturally:
	You define an interface or abstract class
	You implement multiple concrete classes
	You call methods on them via the interface
That is polymorphism. ✅

✅ Technically:
Yes, the code structure of Strategy Pattern and polymorphism is the same, because Strategy Pattern uses polymorphism as its foundation.
They both involve:
	An interface or abstract class
	Multiple implementations
	A reference to the interface, calling the method dynamically at runtime



📌 Then What's the Difference?
================================
✅ Polymorphism = "Mechanism"
A language feature that lets different classes be used interchangeably through a common interface.


✅ Strategy Pattern = "Design Intent"
======================================
A design pattern that uses polymorphism to encapsulate interchangeable behaviors and inject them at runtime.
So yes — the syntax is the same, but the design pattern introduces structure, naming, and intent that pure polymorphism alone doesn’t require.


🧠 Analogy: Same Tool, Different Blueprint
==========================================
Imagine polymorphism is a power socket, and Strategy Pattern is the idea of plugging in different appliances (fan, heater, lamp) based on your need.
