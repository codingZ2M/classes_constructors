/*  Creational Design Patterns(Prototype Pattern)
  ðŸ’¡ Use When:
		You want to create copies of existing objects, especially when creation is expensive.
		
   Real-World Scenario: Duplicating a filled-out form or resume.
   
   Ex: Suppose you have a template document like an invoice or resume, and you want to duplicate it multiple 
   		times with small changes.
   		
   ðŸ§  Why?
		Copying an object is easier than recreating it.
		Good when creation cost is high (e.g., expensive database objects).
