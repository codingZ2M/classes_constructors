/*
 Goal of Inheritance:
 	Inherit fields and methods from a superclass and also define its own behavior.
 	Enables code reuse and creates a hierarchical relationship between classes.
 	All subclasses reuse name, salary, and displayDetails() from Employee - Avoids repeating common attributes and behavior

	// A company with common attributes for all employees
