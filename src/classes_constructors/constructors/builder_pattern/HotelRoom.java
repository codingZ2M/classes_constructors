/*
 Constructor chaining to reduce code duplication ‚Äî that's great for simpler cases and works fine for a small number of fields.
  But as more features like hasWiFi, roomNumber, isSmokingAllowed, viewType, etc. are added, the constructor becomes hard to read, 
  use, and maintain. 
  And also, adding a new field forces you to change every place that calls this constructor.
  Builder Pattern is designed to solve exactly this ‚Äî creating scalable, readable object construction.

/*
 ‚úÖ Why This Is Scalable:
Easy to add new fields:
	Just add a field in Builder, a setter method, and update the build() logic.
	No changes needed in client code if the new field is optional.
No parameter order confusion:
	It's readable: the method names clearly show what each field is.
Optional fields are truly optional:
	You only set what you need, and defaults can be handled internally.


üîÅ Alternative: Use Multiple Constructors or Setters (Less Ideal)
You could use constructor overloading or setters, but:
	Overloading leads to explosion of constructor variants.
	Setters make objects mutable ‚Äî which may be unsafe if the object should be immutable.
	
üîö Summary
To make constructors scalable for future features like hasWiFi, roomNumber, etc.:
	Use the Builder pattern: flexible, readable, and clean.
	Avoid long parameter lists and constructor overloading as your object grows.
	Builders are the standard, scalable approach in Java for complex object creation.
