  üéØ How Is It a Simplified Interface?
	‚ùå Without the Facade (Client code would look like this):

		FlightBooking flight = new FlightBooking();
		HotelBooking hotel = new HotelBooking();

			hotel.bookHotel();

		How many subsystems exist (FlightBooking, HotelBooking)
		What methods to call, and in what order
